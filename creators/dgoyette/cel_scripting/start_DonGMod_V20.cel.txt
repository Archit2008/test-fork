#  Simply uncomment one or more of the lines below, as noted. Each line or  *
#  section of code contains comments describing what it does. To UNcomment  *
#  a line of code, simply remove the "#" character from the beginning of    *
#  that line.                                                               *

#  If you decide to modify this script, please copy it to a safe place      *
#  BEFORE you begin, so you will have it to refer to at a later date.       *
#                                                                           *

#****************************************************************************
#  Those four lines of code (above) are the entire start.cel script. Here   *
#  is a description of what each line does...                               *
#                                                                           *
#  select: Tells Celestia what object (planet, moon, spacecraft, etc.) to   *
#          define as the currently selected object. Sol defines our solar   *
#          system, the "/" character is merely a hierarchy divider, Earth   *
#          is the object we want to select. If you wanted to select our     *
#          Moon, the select command would look like the following:          *
#            select {object "Sol/Earth/Moon"}                               *
#                                                                           *
#  follow: Tells Celestia to follow the selected object through space,      *
#          just like pressing the "F" key on the keyboard. You could        *
#          replace the follow {} command with synchronous {}, which allows  *
#          you to remain in a stationary, or geosynchronous orbit above     *
#          the selected object.                                             *
#                                                                           *
#  goto:   Tells Celestia to travel to the currently selected object, just  *
#          like pressing the "G" key on the keyboard. The time parameter    *
#          defines how many seconds it should take to travel there. The     *
#          distance parameter defines how far away from the object to be    *
#          positioned, in units of the object's radius, plus 1. For         *
#          example, if the object's radius is 10000 km, and you specify     *
#          6.0 for distance, you will be positioned 50000 km from the       *
#          center of the object.                                            *
#                                                                           *
#  wait:   Since the goto command is telling Celestia to take some time to  *
#          do something, we need to give Celestia that same amount of time  *
#          to actually DO it. So, the wait command tells Celestia to wait   *
#          for 5 seconds while the goto takes place (for 5 seconds). The    *
#          duration parameter value should be the same as the time          *
#          parameter in the goto command.                                   *
#                                                                           *

#  If you want to be positioned above YOUR specific location on Earth, use  *
#  the gotolonglat command shown below. Step-by-step instructions...        *
#                                                                           *

#  * Remove the "#" character at the beginning of the line. This UNcomments *
#    the line of code so it will be executed.                               *

#  * Add a "#" character to the beginning of the original goto command.     *
#    This turns the line of code into a comment, so it will NOT be run.     *

#  If you would like Celestia to always start at a specific date/time, use  *
#  the time command, as shown below. This is useful if you always want to   *
#  start with an object showing it's sunny side.                            *
#                                                                           *
